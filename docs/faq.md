    # Why github workflow `release & publish` failed?
    We have used a github action `heinrichreimer/github-changelog-generator-action` to
    generate change log automatically for your project. However, this action requires
    some configuration.

    Goto .github/workflows/release.yml (in your project folder), find the following:
    ```
        - name: generate change log
        uses: heinrichreimer/github-changelog-generator-action@v2.1.1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          issues: true
          issuesWoLabels: true
          pullRequests: true
          prWoLabels: true
          unreleased: true
          addSections: '{"documentation":{"prefix":"**Documentation:**","labels":["documentation"]}}'
          #sinceTag: v0.1.1
          output: CHANGELOG.md
    ```
    uncomment `#sinceTag` line and given an existed tag name in your project. If 
    there's none, you have to create one now.

    # Why not travis CI?
    Travis CI is a great service, however, github actions is super convenient, less configuration
    , better integration. Less configuration, less error prone.

???+ Question
    # Why not read the docs?
    Same reason as above. Git pages is convenient than read the docs, it requires no
    further configuration, except access token. As to read the docs, you need to
    write v2 config file, plus several settings on web pages.

    # Why mkdocs over sphinx?
    reStructured Text and Sphinx is way to tedious, though powerful. With extension, 
    you'll find almost all features are available in mkdocs, in a neat and productive 
    way. Poetry and Markdown, are the two key factors driven me develop this template.
